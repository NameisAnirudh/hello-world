# hello-world
The first project- Not so much to see

Hi there ,
 I'm fond of python, learnt a lil bit and JUST started learning Machine Learning with octave.
 Good idea?!
 Honestly, I'm finding myself struggling in that area without programming knowledge.
 Even then in trying to catch up. Will appreciate any and all that supports me on my learning process.. Thank you..

Also, the point of this project is asking for suggestions, help to create, collaborate, and develop innovative ideas..
So I'm happy if you share a few !! 

So, Thanks again folks, and have a good one!!
